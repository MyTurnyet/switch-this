# Arlo Belshee's Git Commit Notation

## Core Format
- Follow this structure: `{prefix} {description}`
- Format the prefix in brackets: `[prefix]` 
- Keep descriptions concise and descriptive
- The first letter after the prefix must be capitalized
- Example: `[F] Add user authentication feature`

## Commit Prefixes
### Based on Arlo Belshee's Notation:

- `[F]` = Feature: New functionality or completed user story
- `[B]` = Bug: Fix for a bug
- `[R]` = Refactor: Change that doesn't impact functionality
- `[c]` = chore: Maintenance task that isn't a feature, bug fix, or refactor
- `[d]` = docs: Documentation only changes
- `[s]` = style: Changes that don't affect code meaning (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- `[t]` = test: Adding or refactoring tests (no production code change)
- `[a]` = arch: Architectural changes
- `[e]` = experiment: Experimental code that might be removed
- `[D]` = Developer-oriented task (dev-only)

## Additional Notation
### Namespacing (optional)
- Add module or component name in parentheses after the prefix
- Example: `[F][login] Add OAuth support`

### Pairing/Mobbing Notation (optional)
- `@` = Paired commit (followed by pair partner's initials)
- `@@` = Mobbed commit (whole team)
- Example: `[F]@JD Add password reset functionality`

## Checking Commit Format
1. Ensure each commit message starts with a recognized prefix in brackets
2. Verify the description is clear and concise
3. Check that the first letter of the description is capitalized
4. Verify namespacing is correctly formatted (if used)
5. Verify pairing notation is correctly formatted (if used)

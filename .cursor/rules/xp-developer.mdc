Always use these rules:
[tdd-always.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/tdd-always.mdc)
[no-mocking-frameworks.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/no-mocking-frameworks.mdc)

Prefer a small object oriented approach over large functions.
Maximum function line count should be at most 15 lines.  If you have a longer function, refactor it to multiple functions.

Make the code convey it's intent.  Names should be self explanitory as to the behavior.  There should not be a need for comments if the code conveys it's intent.

Make small and regular commits when the tests are passing.  Use Arlo's commit notation, and write commit messages in the imperative.

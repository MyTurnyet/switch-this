# Test Fix Summary

## Completed Work

We've successfully implemented the following improvements to tests:

1. **Created MongoDB Testing Utilities**
   - Added `mongodb.provider.ts` to facilitate mocking MongoDB services
   - Created `mongodb-test-utils.ts` with standardized mock implementations
   - Added example test in `mongodb-test-example.test.ts`

2. **Standardized Test Pattern**
   - Added `api-test-template.ts` with examples for API route tests
   - Created a README with documentation on how to fix tests

3. **Fixed Specific Tests**
   - Fixed the Dashboard component test to properly handle null data
   - Fixed the useLocationQueries test with proper mocking
   - Restored the ReactQueryProvider that was deleted

## Current Test Status

- 17 passing test suites
- 1 failing test suite (layout-state API)
- Several API route tests still need fixing

## Remaining Work

The remaining test failures can be fixed by:

1. **Update API Route Tests**
   - Use the API test template and MongoDB test utilities for all API route tests
   - Replace direct MongoDB mocking with standardized approach

2. **Specific Test Fixes Needed**
   - Fix `/api/layout-state/__tests__/route.test.ts` - Currently failing with ObjectId mocking issues
   - Fix `/api/locations/__tests__/route.test.ts` - Currently has syntax errors
   - Fix `/api/industries/__tests__/route.test.ts` - Currently has syntax errors 
   - Fix `/api/rolling-stock/[id]/__tests__/route.test.ts` - Currently failing with NextResponse issues
   - Fix `/api/switchlists/__tests__/route.test.ts` - Currently failing with MongoDB provider issues
   - Fix `/api/train-routes/[id]/__tests__/route.test.ts` - Currently failing with MongoDB provider issues

## How to Fix Remaining Tests

To fix the remaining tests:

1. **For Each API Route Test**
   - Replace direct MongoDB mocking with our standardized utilities
   - Use the pattern shown in `api-test-template.ts`
   - Properly cast mocks when working with collection methods
   - Follow the examples in the README

2. **For Each MongoDB Mock**
   - Use `createMockMongoService()` to create a consistent mock
   - Configure mock responses using type assertions like `(collection.find as jest.Mock)`
   - Ensure proper mocking of NextResponse

3. **For Each Test File**
   - Start with a clean implementation based on the templates
   - Set up the test environment consistently
   - Verify all assertions match the expected behavior
